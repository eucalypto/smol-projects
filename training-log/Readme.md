# Training repetition logger

This logger waits for you to input the number of repetitions you just did.
It then logs them for you with the current timestamp.

## Why?

I wrote this logger because I like to spread out my sets over a long time.
But then I want to log not only the number of reps but also the timestamp 
of the set. And this is the perfect job for a computer! ^-^
